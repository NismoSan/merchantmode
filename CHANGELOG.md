## v1.1.0

### New Features
- **Global Merchant Network** — MerchantMode now connects to the AislingExchange merchant hub (`wss://api.aislingexchange.com/ws/merchants`). Your active listings, character name, and map location are shared in real time with other MerchantMode users
- **All Merchants page** — new "All Merchants" tab on the Dashboard shows every online MerchantMode user in a card grid with their listings, location, and character sprite/avatar pulled from AislingExchange profiles
- **All Merchants listings view** — the "All Merchants" tab on the Listings page shows a unified, type-grouped list of every listing from every online merchant, with avatar, player name, and map location per row
- **Character sprites & avatars** — merchant cards and listing rows display each character's AislingExchange avatar circle (with custom crop offsets) and full sprite image, fetched via the AE API and proxied through Electron
- **Character face in tabs** — character tabs now show a cropped face sprite to the left of the character name for quick visual identification
- **Trade listing auto-matching** — whispers now match against TRADE listings by the wanted item name (what the whisperer has), not the offered item name
- **Trade auto-fill** — the exchange engine now automatically places your offered item from inventory when a trade listing is matched, supporting both stackable and non-stackable items
- **Trade auto-reply** — customizable whisper reply template for trade listings with `{item}` and `{wanted}` placeholders
- **Location tracking** — new `LocationTracker` module tracks each character's current map name and coordinates, broadcast to the merchant hub on every map change
- **Whisper rate limiting** — auto-replies are now rate-limited to one per player per 10 seconds to prevent reply loops

### Bug Fixes
- **Exchange accept reset** — adding items or gold on your side now correctly resets the other party's accept state, preventing premature confirmation
- **Disconnect cleanup** — character context cleanup on disconnect is now more robust, matching by connection reference as a fallback and properly cleaning up location tracker listeners
- **Stack quantity rounding** — whisper-matched quantities are now rounded to the nearest stack size multiple when selling stacked items
